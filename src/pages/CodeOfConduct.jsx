          IntegraYouth strongly values responsibility, transparency, and good
          communication, and there is an expectation that tutors and tutees do
          as well. Once you become a volunteer at IntegraYouth, a small set of
          conditions must be acknowledged and agreed to. This is to ensure that
          the IntegraYouth executive team, students, and volunteers have a
          pleasant and quality experience.
